/**
 * Design Principles,

 * 1. The Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
 * <p>
 * First pattern used in this chapter: <b>Iterator Pattern</b>, The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the
 * elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It also places the task
 * of traversal on the iterator object, not on the aggregate, which simplifies the aggregate interface and
 * implementation, and places the responsibility where it should be.
 * <p>
 * Second pattern used in this chapter: <b>Composite Pattern</b>, The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects
 * into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
 * compositions of objects uniformly.
