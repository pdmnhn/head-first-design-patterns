/**
 * Design Principles,

 * 1. Dependency Inversion: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

 * Pattern used in this chapter: <b>Factory Method Pattern</b>,
 * The factory method pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to
 * instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
