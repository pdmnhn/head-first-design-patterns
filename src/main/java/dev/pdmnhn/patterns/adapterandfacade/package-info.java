/**
 * Design Principles,
 * <p>
 * 1. The Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends. The Principle of Least knowledge guides us
 * to reduce the interactions between objects to just a few close "friends".
 * <p>
 * First pattern used in this chapter: <b> Adapter Pattern</b>, The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class
 * into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of
 * incompatible interfaces.
 * <p>
 * Second pattern used in this chapter: <b> Facade Pattern </b>, The facade pattern provides a unified interface to a
 * set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
