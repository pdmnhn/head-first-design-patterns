/**
 * Design Principles,
 * <p>
 * 1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
 * <p>
 * 2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
 * <p>
 * 3. Favour composition over inheritance.
 * <p>
 * Pattern used in this chapter: <b>Strategy Pattern</b>, The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
 * encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients
 * that use it.
