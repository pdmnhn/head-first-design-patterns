/**
 * Design Principles,
 * <p>
 * 1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
 * <p>
 * 2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
 * <p>
 * 3. Favour composition over inheritance.
 * <p>
 * Pattern used in this chapter: <b>Singleton Pattern</b>,
 * The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
